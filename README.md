# Implement Anomaly Detection with LearningApi K-Mean Algorithm
In term of Data Clustering K-Mean Algorithm is the most popular.  K-mean is basically used for clustering numeric data. Here, I implement k-mean algorithm through LearningApi to detect the anomaly from a data sate. From this Data cluster, Anomaly Detection is a process to find the unusual data which is different from other clustering data. 
#	PROJECT OVERVIEW
Machine learning is a process which is used by computer with some algorithm and statistical model to perform some specific task by itself. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task. To detect the anomaly from data set is one of them. 

In anomaly detection, the task is to discover which parts of a collection are most odd with regard to the rest of the collection. For occasion, in case we had a collection of numeric information with height and width, we would need to identity anomalous, since it has different height and width with regard to the rest of the records within the collection. In this example we have no prior knowledge or training data.

There has lot of procedure to detect anomaly from data sets. Those method are also depending on the data type. For numeric data sets k-mean gives more accurate result. The focus point of my project is that integrate anomaly detection with LearningApi.

A numeric data sets will import through unit test. As a result, the data will use to train the LearningAPI which is using K-mean algorithm to make the data Cluster and detect the anomalies.

It provides a unique processing API for Machine Learning solutions. Here I used K-mean algorithm to make cluster of data and detect anomaly. Software testing with Unit test is a process, where individual components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. I used different unit test to check the accuracy of my project.
